# SSH Access

The Terraform module creates a local SSH configuration file containing jump host details. Once FreeIPA is set up and hosts are enrolled, use this to access deployment hosts.

## Using the SSH Config

```bash
ssh -F <name_prefix>-ssh.config <hostname>
```

## SSH Config Structure

The generated config follows this pattern:

```ssh-config
# Jump host (gateway with public IP)
Host jump
  HostName <GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP>
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile /path/to/<name_prefix>-ssh-key.pem

# Internal hosts via jump proxy
Host *.<dns_domain>
  User ec2-user
  IdentityFile /path/to/<name_prefix>-ssh-key.pem
  ProxyJump jump
  ForwardAgent yes
```

## Direct Access

You can also SSH directly to the gateway:

```bash
ssh -i <name_prefix>-ssh-key.pem ec2-user@<GATEWAY_PUBLIC_IP>
```

Then hop to internal hosts from the gateway:

```bash
ssh <hostname>.<dns_domain>
```

!!! tip
    Host FQDNs use the internal domain (default: `cldr.internal`). For example: `myprefix-base-master-0.cldr.internal`.
