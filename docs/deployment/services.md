# Services

The services playbook configures all supporting infrastructure services on the provisioned hosts.

## What It Configures

| Service | Host | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| OS & Networking | All hosts | System prerequisites, DNS resolution |
| FreeIPA | Services host | DNS, Kerberos KDC, certificate authority |
| PostgreSQL | Services host | Databases for CM and services |
| pgAdmin | Services host | Database administration UI |
| Caddy | Gateway | Reverse proxy with TLS termination |
| Node Exporter | All hosts | System metrics (when monitoring enabled) |
| Prometheus | Services host | Metrics collection (when monitoring enabled) |
| Grafana | Services host | Metrics dashboards (when monitoring enabled) |

## Run

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/services.yml -e @config.yml
```

## Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `system` | OS configuration and networking |
| `system_services` | System-level service setup |
| `freeipa` | All FreeIPA tasks |
| `freeipa_server` | FreeIPA server installation |
| `freeipa_client` | FreeIPA client enrollment |
| `database` | PostgreSQL and pgAdmin |
| `pgadmin` | pgAdmin setup |
| `monitoring` | Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter |
| `ecs_dns` | ECS DNS record provisioning |

## Feature Toggles

These are controlled via `config.yml` or `group_vars/all.yml`:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `enable_prometheus` | `false` | Deploys Node Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana |
| `enable_freeipa_wildcard_profile` | `false` | Creates wildcard certificate profile in FreeIPA |
| `enable_postgres_tls` | `false` | Enrolls PostgreSQL with FreeIPA-signed TLS certs |
| `enable_prereq_freeipa_client` | `true` | Runs prereq_freeipa_client role before enrollment |

## Reverse Proxy Endpoints

After the services playbook completes, the following endpoints are available via the Caddy reverse proxy on the gateway:

- `https://cm.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — Cloudera Manager
- `https://freeipa.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — FreeIPA Web UI
- `https://pgadmin.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — pgAdmin
- `https://knox.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — Knox Gateway

When monitoring is enabled:

- `https://prometheus.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — Prometheus
- `https://grafana.<gateway_ip>.<public_domain>` — Grafana
