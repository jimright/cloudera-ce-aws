# Deployment Overview

The deployment runs in four stages, each handled by a dedicated playbook:

| Stage | Playbook | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1. Infrastructure | `infrastructure.yml` | ~10 min | AWS networking and hosts via Terraform |
| 2. Services | `services.yml` | ~15 min | DNS, Kerberos, database, proxy, monitoring |
| 3. Cloudera Manager | `cms.yml` | ~10 min | CM server, agents, AutoTLS, LDAP |
| 4. Cluster | `*-cluster.yml` | ~15 min | CDP Runtime cluster deployment |

## Run All Stages

To deploy everything in one command:

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/infrastructure.yml playbooks/services.yml playbooks/cms.yml playbooks/ozone-cluster.yml -e @config.yml
```

Total runtime: approximately **40–50 minutes**.

## Run Stages Individually

Each stage can be run independently:

Provision infrastructure:

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/infrastructure.yml -e @config.yml
```

Configure services:

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/services.yml -e @config.yml
```

Install Cloudera Manager:

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/cms.yml -e @config.yml
```

Deploy cluster:

```bash
ansible-navigator run playbooks/ozone-cluster.yml -e @config.yml
```

## Available Cluster Topologies

After stages 1–3, deploy any of the following clusters:

| Playbook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ozone-cluster.yml` | Ozone-enabled base cluster |
| `kafka-cluster.yml` | Kafka base cluster |
| `flink-cluster.yml` | Flink base cluster |
| `nifi-cluster.yml` | NiFi (CFM) cluster |
| `nifi2.0-cluster.yml` | NiFi 2.0 cluster |
| `csa-cluster.yml` | CSA (Cloudera Streaming Analytics) full cluster |

!!! tip
    The cluster playbooks are designed to be run after the base deployment (infrastructure + services + CMS). You can deploy multiple cluster configurations sequentially.
