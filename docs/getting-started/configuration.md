# Configuration

## Create config.yml

Copy the configuration template:

```bash
cp config-template.yml config.yml
```

## Mandatory Parameters

Fill in the following minimum parameters in `config.yml`:

```yaml
name_prefix: ""       # Unique identifier for the deployment (used in resource names and tags)
infra_region: ""      # AWS region (e.g. us-east-2, eu-west-1)
common_password: ""   # Min 8 chars, must include 1 number
owner_email: ""       # Your Cloudera email (used for resource tagging and pgAdmin login)
```

## Optional Overrides

All other parameters have sensible defaults defined in `group_vars/all.yml`. Override any of them in your `config.yml` as needed:

### Version Pins

```yaml
cloudera_manager_version: 7.13.2
cloudera_runtime_version: 7.3.2
jdk_version: 17
```

### Domain Configuration

```yaml
dns_domain: "cldr.internal"            # Internal domain managed by local FreeIPA
public_domain: "pvc.cloudera-labs.com"  # External domain for reverse proxy endpoints
```

### Feature Toggles

```yaml
enable_prometheus: false                 # Node Exporter, Prometheus, Grafana
enable_freeipa_wildcard_profile: false   # Wildcard cert profile in FreeIPA (for ECS)
enable_postgres_tls: false               # PostgreSQL TLS enrollment via FreeIPA
enable_prereq_freeipa_client: true       # Include prereq_freeipa_client role
```

### TLS Configuration

```yaml
caddy_self_signed: true   # Use self-signed TLS for the reverse proxy
```

!!! note
    If you wish to use an intermediate CA for the reverse proxy TLS (TLS termination), please contact #sme_automation on Slack.

## SSH Credentials

The Terraform module generates a new SSH private key automatically. You will find the `.pem` file in the project root directory after running the `infrastructure.yml` playbook.

To use **existing** SSH credentials instead:

```yaml
ssh_pem_file: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE') }}"
```

!!! warning
    You must use a **passwordless, OpenSSH (RFC4716)** compliant SSH key.

!!! warning
    The SSH private key must be accessible within the Execution Environment container's mounted volumes. The controller's `~/.ssh` directory is typically mounted automatically.
